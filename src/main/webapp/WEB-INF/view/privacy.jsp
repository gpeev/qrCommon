            <p>Following is our privacy policy, which explains how your information is collected, used and protected. We
                reserve the right to change this policy and will provide notification of any material change on this web
                site. You may contact us with any questions regarding this policy on our <a href="/support">Support

        <dt>Data Collection and Storage</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>During user registration and listing creation process, we collect account information including password
                and contact information such as name, email and telephone number. Each of these different types of
                information is used to provide the peekinsi.de service. Registration information is used to
                authenticate users, and contact information is used both for service-related communication and as an
                integral component of the application. In some cases, contact information will be sent to third party
                syndication partners who have the ability to anonymize email addresses.</p>

            <p>All user information contained within the application will remain your property. We will continue to make
                that data available to you as long as you are a user, and make that data available to you upon the
                termination of your relationship with peekinsi.de. If at some point peekinsi.de sells all or a portion
                of its assets, or merges with another entity, user information is an asset that may be transferred or
                acquired by a third party. We will notify all affected users of any such transaction, and users will
                have the opportunity to retrieve their user information and cease usage of the service. After such a
                transaction, the third party that becomes the custodian of the user information would have the right to
                continue using the user information solely as set forth in this policy.</p>

            <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This
                information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider,
                referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this
                information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends to administer the site to track
                users` movements around the site and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>

            <p>All collected information is stored in our database, and, even after deletion, may be archived. Our web
                logs and other records are stored indefinitely.</p>

            <p>peekinsi.de does not target its offerings toward, and does not knowingly collect any personal
                information from users under 13 years of age.</p>

        <dt>Syndication and Links to Third Party Sites</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>peekinsi.de, or others who use our service, may transfer listing information and/or provide links to
                third party web sites, which may have different privacy practices. We make no representations or
                warranties about the policies and practices of sites that are linked to by peekinsi.de or its users. We
                urge you to consult the policies available on those sites to further understand your rights.</p>

        <dt>Security</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>We have implemented processes designed to protect user information and maintain security. Each registered
                user sets their own password which is required to access their user information. It is the user`s
                responsibility to protect the security of their login information. Although we make good faith efforts
                to store the information in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we
                cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
